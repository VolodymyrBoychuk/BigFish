            complex production systems with performance-critical database access, large data flows,
            and tight integration between frontend and backend.
            We know how to structure your app for real-world scale — from hybrid UIKit/SwiftUI
            interfaces to asynchronous state flows and optimized data access (CoreData, SQLite,
            CloudKit, or custom APIs).`,
